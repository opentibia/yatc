### Automatically added by Hedron's Bazel Compile Commands Extractor: https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor
# Ignore the `external` link (that is added by `bazel-compile-commands-extractor`). The link differs between macOS/Linux and Windows, so it shouldn't be checked in. The pattern must not end with a trailing `/` because it's a symlink on macOS/Linux.
/external
# Ignore links to Bazel's output. The pattern needs the `*` because people can change the name of the directory into which your repository is cloned (changing the `bazel-<workspace_name>` symlink), and must not end with a trailing `/` because it's a symlink on macOS/Linux.
/bazel-*
# Ignore generated output. Although valuable (after all, the primary purpose of `bazel-compile-commands-extractor` is to produce `compile_commands.json`!), it should not be checked in.
/compile_commands.json
# Ignore the directory in which `clangd` stores its local index.
